## Uptask MERN - Full Stack Project


# Description

Uptask MERN is a full stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project that serves as a project manager with login functionality. It allows users to add, edit, and delete projects. The backend of the project was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.io, while the client-side utilizes Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, and Socket.io.

This project is based on the teachings of Professor Juan Pablo De la Torre Valdez in his course "React - La gu√≠a completa" available on Udemy. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to React and covers various topics related to building full stack applications using the MERN stack.

## Features

* User authentication: Users can create accounts and log in to access the project manager.
* Project management: Users can add new projects, edit existing projects, and delete projects.
* Real-time updates: The application utilizes Socket.io to provide real-time updates to all connected clients when changes are made to projects.
